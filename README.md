## Inspiration
Online Classes inspired us the most for this project.
So here goes the story!
>Everybody is locked in.
>Online classes are the norm.
>Everybody is bored.
>Its time to stream some movies and chill out.

But of course how do you **chill out** ?
Sitting or lazying around in awkward positions.

Sorry to be a spoil sport , but that effects your **spine and muscles**!! 

So what did we do about it ?
Find out!!

## What it does
It's a software that uses existing tech (webcams ) on laptops , and integrates them with hand gestures. So now you can control the media using only your hands.

And not just media , we also made **one for the internet.**

So now you can swish around as much as you like and feel like **Professor X** from x-men ( the guy who can move stuff using his finger alone)

## How we built it
We chose **python** ,for its diversity in library selections.
We mainly used [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/).
We used the pre trained hand and body recogniser from mediapipe and used a bit of math to figure out the proper co-ordinate mappings.



## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a few problems on our way.
- Configuration of co-ordinates for web scrolling (a bit of math)
- Media Player adaptation (different stuff works on different player (vlc,quick time etc) )
- Getting things to work the way we want them too 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to _browse_ the web and consume media _in a better manner_ using our program.
We were also able to work through our differences and code errors.
We worked as a team and here is the finished product.
We hope it can bring a little change to the world.

## What we learned

We learnt a lot about mediapipe and how computer vision works.
The mapping of our hands to different co-ordinates and the precision of the system really amazed us.


## What's next for UseAbylity


We aim to package this software into an easy to install , working piece of software which can hopefully correct peoples posture and also be convenient to them.
