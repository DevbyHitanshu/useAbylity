# UseAbylity - Gesture-Controlled Media and Web Browsing

## Introduction

Welcome to UseAbylity, a software solution inspired by the challenges of online classes and the need for healthier, interactive ways to consume media and browse the web. Tired of sitting in awkward positions? UseAbylity empowers you to control your media and internet browsing using hand gestures, giving you a more dynamic and engaging experience.

## Inspiration

Online classes became the catalyst for our project. As everyone shifted to online learning, the monotony of sitting in front of screens led us to explore a solution that combines technology and hand gestures for a more interactive experience.

## How It Works

UseAbylity utilizes the existing webcams on laptops and integrates them with hand gestures. With this software, you can control media playback and internet browsing using simple hand movements. It brings a touch of the extraordinary, allowing you to feel like Professor X from X-Men, manipulating digital elements with your fingers.

## Technology Stack

We chose Python for its diverse library selections and relied on [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/), using its pre-trained hand and body recognition models. A bit of math helped us fine-tune coordinate mappings for web scrolling and media player adaptation.

## Challenges Faced

- Coordinating web scrolling coordinates
- Adapting to different media players (VLC, QuickTime, etc.)
- Fine-tuning the system for optimal performance

## Accomplishments

We successfully created a program that enhances web browsing and media consumption through gesture control. Overcoming coding challenges and differences within the team, we are proud to present the finished product, hoping it brings positive change to the way people interact with technology.

## Lessons Learned

Our journey with UseAbylity taught us valuable lessons about computer vision, hand-to-coordinate mapping precision, and the intricacies of working with MediaPipe.

## What's Next for UseAbylity

Our future plans involve packaging UseAbylity into easy-to-install software, aiming to correct posture and provide a convenient, interactive experience for users.
